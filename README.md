# Task-Scheduler-with-Notifications
A desktop reminder application built using Python and Tkinter that helps users create and manage scheduled tasks. The app supports due dates, recurring tasks (daily or weekly), and sends real-time desktop notifications using the Plyer library. Task data is saved in SQLite, and unique task IDs are generated using base62 encoding.
